Joanne Intro:  Hi. I’m Joanne Wilson with The Parent Report. No one goes into a marriage hoping for divorce, but sometimes it’s the best choice for a couple.  Fortunately, studies show that if well handled by the adults, children will adjust to the new family arrangements within two years.  Longer than that and there may be other issues at play, says Nicolas Long, co-author of Parenting the Strong-Willed Child. (21)


Clip:   “When you see… children’s adjustment.”		(:33.5)
	(When you see child adjustment problems beyond that one to two year period, it’s typically not because the parents aren’t living together anymore, it’s typically because of other things that are going on within the family.  The primary cause of children’s long-term adjustment difficulties to divorce is how much conflict there is between the parents after divorce.  There are conflicts about custody and other issues that children over-hear.  That seems to have a significant negative effect on children’s adjustment.)
