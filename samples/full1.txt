Joanne Intro:  Hi.  I'm Joanne Wilson with The Parent Report. Grandparents play a special role in children's lives, but when a child's parents divorce, a grandparents role can change.  However with the right attitude from both the parents and grandparents, children can still have a great relationship with Gramma and Grampa.  Mark Ackerman, author of Does Wednesday Means Moms House or Dads? elaborates. (20.5)

Clip: "The perfect grandparent...parent, together."	(:33)
	(The perfect grandparent would be supportive, would continue to communicate even if it's just at a cordial level with the parent who is divorcing their child, to continue to maintain a relationship with the grandchildren and not change anything more than is necessary, and to recognize the fact, to use the old adage, that it takes two to tango. In other words, it wasn't just the other parent who probably caused the problem, it probably was their child and the other parent, together.)
