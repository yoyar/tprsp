Joanne Intro:  Hi.  I'm Joanne Wilson with The Parent Report. So often when we think of the internet and children, internet safety comes to mind.  And while it's important to be cautious of how children use the internet, it does have it's benefits for today's families as Joanie Farley Gillispie, author of Cyber Rules explains.(16.5)

Clip: "Media allows us...families stronger"	(:22.5)
	(Media allows us to be more organized and connect more with our family , believe it or not. I always encourage parents to email their children  and their kids to email their parents, especially if they're working through a difficult issue. It's a wonderful way to keep the door of communication open, so I like using media and I think we can use it to make our lives and our families stronger.)

Joanne Bridge:  While the internet has it's benefits, Joanie adds that we need to keep it in its place. (4)

Clip: "We need to make...in healthy ways,"	(:12.5)
	(We need to make really sure that the way it's imbedded into our relationships are healthy and positive and sustainable, and that we don't let the internet use us, but that we learn how to use the internet in healthy ways.)
