TPR Script Parser

This parser generator configuration exists to facilitate the creation of web 
content (or any other content) from scripts originally composed using M$ Word. 

This is an atypical use of Flex/Bison. It is purpose specific and likely won't
be useful as is for anyone in general. However, it may be instructive for 
someone trying to learn about Flex and Bison.

The scripts are converted to plain text using `anitword' and `iconv'. 
    example:
    antiword -t -w0 script.doc | iconv -t UTF8 -f UTF8

The lines of interest in the scripts do have some structure. For example, they 
more or less conform, with a few exceptions, to the format:
    header: words (time specification)

The goal is to parse the plain text and convert it to a more usable format 
(i.e. json or xml).

You can test the script parser like this:
    ./tprsp < samples/full1.txt

This parser requires the Jansson json library. http://www.digip.org/jansson/
