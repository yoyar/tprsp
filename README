This parser generator configuration exists to facilitate the creation of web 
content (or any other content) from scripts originally composed using M$ Word. 

The scripts are converted to plain text using the program `anitword'. 

The lines of interest in the scripts do have some structure. They more or less conform
to the format: 
    header: words (time specification)

The goal is to parse the plain text and convert it to a more usable format 
(i.e. json or xml).

You can test the script parser like this:
    ./sp < samples/tease.txt

This is very much a work in progress.
