TPR Script Parser

This parser generator configuration exists to facilitate the creation of web 
content (or any other content) from scripts originally composed using M$ Word. 

The scripts are converted to plain text using `anitword' and `iconv'. 
    example:
    antiword -t -w0 script.doc | iconv -t ASCII//TRANSLIT -f UTF8

The lines of interest in the scripts do have some structure. They more or less 
conform to the format, with a few exceptions: 
    header: words (time specification)

The goal is to parse the plain text and convert it to a more usable format 
(i.e. json or xml).

You can test the script parser like this:
    ./sp < samples/full1.txt

There is a simple compilation script in ./build

This parser requires the Jansson json library. http://www.digip.org/jansson/
